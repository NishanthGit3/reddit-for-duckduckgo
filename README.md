# Reddit for DuckDuckGo
## Description:  
A simple browser add-on, that switches your engine from DuckDuckGo to Google when you include the term 'reddit' in your searches.  

This add-on was made due to DuckDuckGo not properly showing recent reddit threads in its searches, so the engine switches temporarily to Google as Google doesn't have this issue.
